# A Python alarm clock for windows

For those times when you want your pc to wake you up.

You could also use this to schedule an action for a specific time. 
Replace the last line with the action you want to start on alarm. For me it opens a music track with the default player (VLC). 

# Usage examples

Using the Windows cmd tool: 

`python alarm.py 7 0`

`python alarm.py 07 00`

`python alarm.py 13 30`

Note that it uses the 24-hour time format.
